<h1>Surge Management Application</h1>
<h3>For measuring surge levels in the Emergency Department of a hospital</h3>
I made this project for my dad, who is an ER doctor. He gave me a flowchart and some general instructions on how he imagined this application working, and I executed it. This project has gone through several phases of re-evaluation.

This application uses a Node.js server with a PostgreSQL database.

Node packages include

- Experss

- Socket.io

- nodemailer

among others
