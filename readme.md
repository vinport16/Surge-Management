<h1>Surge Management Application</h1>
<h3>For measuring surge levels in the Emergency Department of a hospital</h3>
I made this project for my dad, who is an ER doctor. He gave me a flowchart and some general instructions on how he imagined this application working, and I executed it. This project has gone through several phases of re-evaluation.

<h4>Functionality</h4>
This application

- is password protected

- uses data from the user to calculate a surge level

- stores inputted data

- displays data in a compact and orderly way
